# versu

_Compose the epic of your code, one release at a time._

**VERSU** is an intelligent versioning automation tool that eliminates manual version management in multi-module projects. By leveraging [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/), VERSU automatically analyzes your commit history, determines semantic version bumps, manages dependency cascades, and generates changelogs — all without developer intervention!

Whether you're working on a monorepo with dozens of interdependent modules or a simple single-module project, VERSU adapts to your workflow. Use it as a library in your custom tools, as a CLI in your terminal, or as a GitHub Action in your CI/CD pipeline. With its extensible plugin architecture, VERSU supports any build system or language ecosystem.

## 🔑 Key Features

## 🤔 Why VERSU?

### 🎯 The Problem

Managing versions in multi-module projects is painful:

- **Manual versioning is error-prone** - Developers forget to bump versions or choose the wrong increment
- **Dependencies are a nightmare** - When module A changes, which dependents need bumping? It's easy to miss cascading impacts
- **Inconsistent practices** - Different team members have different versioning philosophies
- **Changelog chaos** - Manually maintained changelogs become outdated or incomplete
- **CI/CD complexity** - Building robust versioning automation from scratch is time-consuming

### ✨ The Solution

VERSU automates the entire versioning lifecycle:

- **Zero manual decisions** - Your commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `BREAKING CHANGE:`) dictate version bumps automatically
- **Smart dependency tracking** - When a module changes, VERSU automatically identifies and versions all dependents
- **Team consistency** - Everyone follows the same Conventional Commits standard, ensuring uniform versioning
- **Generated changelogs** - Beautiful, accurate changelogs generated per-module from commit history
- **Pre-release support** - Seamlessly generate alpha, beta, rc, or custom pre-release versions for testing
- **Ecosystem agnostic** - Works with Gradle, npm, Maven, or any ecosystem through custom plugins

### 🚀 Who Should Use VERSU?

- **Monorepo teams** managing multiple interdependent packages
- **Library maintainers** who want automated, semantic versioning
- **DevOps engineers** building robust CI/CD pipelines
- **Open source projects** seeking consistent release practices
- **Enterprise teams** needing audit trails and predictable versioning

## 📦 Packages

VERSU provides four packages for different use cases. For more details, see the individual package READMEs.

### [@versu/core](packages/core)

Core library with the `VersuRunner` API for programmatic version management. Framework-agnostic and extensible through plugins.

**Use when:** Building custom tools or integrations that need version management.

### [@versu/cli](packages/cli)

Command-line interface for interactive version management in local development and CI/CD pipelines.

**Use when:** You need CLI control or want to integrate with non-GitHub CI/CD systems.

### [@versu/action](packages/action)

GitHub Actions integration for automated versioning in workflow pipelines.

**Use when:** You want automated versioning in GitHub workflows.

### [@versu/plugin-gradle](packages/plugin-gradle)

Gradle adapter plugin that provides support for detecting and updating versions in Gradle projects (Groovy & Kotlin DSL).

**Use when:** Working with Gradle-based projects and need version management support.

## 📝 Commit Message Format

VERSU uses [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) to automatically determine version bumps:

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Examples (default configuration):**

- `feat(api): add new endpoint` → **minor** bump
- `fix(core): resolve memory leak` → **patch** bump
- `feat!: breaking API change` → **major** bump

> **Note:** Version bump rules are fully configurable via [configuration files](packages/core#configuration).

## 🔌 Extending

To add support for new project types, see the [core package documentation](packages/core#creating-custom-adapters) for instructions on creating custom adapter plugins. Reference [@versu/plugin-gradle](packages/plugin-gradle) as an example implementation.

## 🛠️ Development

### ✔️ Requirements

- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) (Node version manager)
- Node.js (see [.nvmrc](.nvmrc))
- npm

### ⚙️ Setup

```bash
npm install    # Install dependencies
npm run build  # Build all packages
npm test       # Run tests
```
